# discontinued
Full-Stack TypeScript/Rust/SurrealDB web application starring discontinued cars throughout the years.

### Overview
This project has primarly two objectives: First, to make a project with the Rust Language in order to learn it. And secondly, to kind of experience "fast" frameworks.
### Explanation
Following with the second object explained before, since Rust is a fast language, i wanted to try out a web framework to take advantage of this speed, i first tried out Actix-Web (the repository can be found in my repositories), but
it didn't really work for me since the errors that Actix sometimes reported where unfixable for me. Then i moved on to Axum, which for me is the winner in rapidly creating a simple server. It's documentation is top level and the examples are at least not broken.
Secondly, the frontend framework of choice was Solid.js, this is because i simply wanted to try out one of the newer frameworks with notable inventions. So i came up with Solid.js.
Finally, the database, this project works with SurrealDB, a rust-based database, i honestly did liked the implementations it has, the downfall of this database is that, since it's pretty new, there's not much documentation regarding it (in comparison with the giants PSQL, MYSQL...)
so, once you choose it you pretty much have to figure your way in. But once you figure it out it works so smoothly...
